# AP-Lit-Project
Hey!! If you're reading this, you're doing something right! Good job! Ok so this was created basically in one night, so it's pretty messy. Sorry haha. 
Context: This project was made to study the development in the western Bildungsroman novel. It makes more sense accompanied by my spiel. 
Rules/How to play: Pretty self explanatory for the most part. But if you want to choose another option (1, 2, 3), please press "back" and THEN the number you'd like to press. To return to character selection, please press "restart".
